# readme-generator

## Description

This readme generator uses the Inquirer node package in order to prompt a user for information necessary for a professional readme, then takes that input and creates a readme.md file with the input printed out using a markdown template. 

## Installation

To run the application users must first download NodeJS. A step by step guide to download NodeJS onto your machine may be found [here.](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs)

## Usage

Using NodeJS, users may run the application in their terminals. The video linked below demonstrates how a user may load and run the application from start to finish in order to demonstrate a professional readme to their liking.
